# Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects using IBM Cloud
This project aims to design, develop, and evaluate a machine learning model that can automatically classify road and bridge construction projects into their correct PMGSY scheme based on their physical and financial characteristics. The solution will leverage real-world project data and deploy the trained model using IBM Cloud Lite services, enabling intelligent decision support for planners, analysts, and government stakeholders.
